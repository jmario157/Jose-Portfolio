export const HERO_CONTENT = `I’m passionate about learning new things and always looking for ways to improve. Although I don't have work experience 
in my field yet, I enjoy building projects to keep my skills sharp. Initially, I focused solely on Front-end development, but after my internship, 
where I worked extensively with Back-end technologies, I became more interested in that area.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I recently completed my degree in Computer Science Engineering at the Universidad Catolica de Honduras. Although I haven’t 
gained professional experience in my field beyond my remote internship, I’m eager to learn and open to any opportunities for growth. My main strength 
lies in Web Development, both frontend and backend, though I lean slightly more towards frontend. I’m a persistent person, dedicated to meeting goals 
and always aiming to deliver my work at the highest standard possible. I’m a collaborative team player, always open to feedback or suggestions that 
help me improve my performance. Currently, I’m taking courses in Node.js and MySQL to enhance my skills in backend development, as I want to continue 
integrating it into my future projects and build full-stack experience. My goal is to continually grow as a developer and contribute effectively to 
both frontend and backend challenges.`;
